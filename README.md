## First challenge

- Make an image double in size when you hover over it but donâ€™t make it jump.
- Use a transition to make the transformation smooth.
- The transition should happen within 1 second, and the transition-timing-function should be set to ease-in.

## Second challenge

- Use the rotate function to spin an image infinitely.
- The image should rotate without any breaks and stops.
- Don't forget to give your animation a name!

## Third challenge
